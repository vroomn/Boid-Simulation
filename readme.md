# Boid Simulation
This is a simple project to simulate boids, graphically driven by Vulkan

#### Libraries
This project solely uses GLFW for windowing and Vulkan for displaying graphics & other GPU tasks and are included as so
GLFW has been stripped down from the original source repo for the build, so go here -> https://github.com/glfw/glfw for more about it
The Vulkan SDK is required to build, if left in the default install location, nothing will go wrong, otherwise update the CMakeLists
